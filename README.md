Merge Control adds a Chisel item that allows extensive control over how tiles merge, group, and otherwise interact visually with surrounding tiles.
It can be used to create contrasting elements in builds of similar tile types, and add new layers of depth to new and existing builds.

This mod gives you full control over Vanilla tile framing, which applies to any normal or modded tile. Meaning you basically more than double your options for building complexity.

Recipe is 2 wooden platforms, and 6 iron bars at any workbench.
Actuation abilities unlock after killing Skeletron.


Specific Features include:
 - Cycling framedata for tiles individually.
 - Actuating blocks without wires (progression-safe)
 - Grouping sets of tiles to only merge with like-groups
 - Full mod compatibility.
 - Full multiplayer compatibility.
 - Safe to enable/disable freely without data loss or corruption.

Coming soon!
 - Client-side version that can be used on ANY server.
 - Wall support.
 - Lighting controls.
 - Additional chisel features.


We're looking for feedback on the mod, including bug reports, feature requests, and anything else you can think of.
Please let us know in the Steam Workshop comments.

Huge thanks to @ba'alcipher#1544 on Discord for commissioning this mod!
