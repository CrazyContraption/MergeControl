Merge Control is the dream mod for builders! - Last Updated 3/10/2023

Merge Control adds a Chisel item that allows extensive control over how tiles merge, group, and otherwise interact visually with surrounding tiles.
It can be used to create contrasting elements in builds of similar tile types, and add new layers of depth to new and existing builds.

This mod gives you full control over Vanilla tile framing, which applies to any normal or modded tile. Meaning you basically more than double your options for building complexity.
